# Analyzing NSW Public Transports - Opal-Cards' Tap-ons and Tap-offs 

This repo is a reup/reorganization/refinement of the same project finished in 2022.

## Project Goals: 
- Analyse different sections of the transport usage in NSW by evaluating the relationship between the tap-on and tap-off rates of Opal cards in 4 suburbs (Parramatta, Strathfield, Chatswood and Macquarie Park). 
- Compare the total uses of different transport modes in NSW, for example, monthly usage of trains and buses over a long period, and examine the impact of demographic factors (age group or personal income) on traveling trends.

## Data Sources: 
The datasets used in the project are data scraped from Transport NSW and Australian Bureau of Statistics.
<br><ul>
<li> Transport NSW: Data recorded houly for each type of transport, can be used for analyzing the amount of tap-ons and tap-offs each day during a week for each suburb. 
<li> Census Table Builder (2016 - from Australian Bureau of Statistics) reports individual weekly income. The data is divided in brackets, ranging from negative and nil income, then the lowest range of $1 to $149 per week to the highest range of over $3000 per week. The salary data is recorded in the following format: weekly (annually). </ul>
<br> Combining the two datasets, we can analyze and predict the relationship between transport and income.
