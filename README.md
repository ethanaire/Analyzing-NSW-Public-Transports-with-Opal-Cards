# Analyzing NSW Public Transports - Opal-Cards' Tap-ons and Tap-offs 

## Project Goals: 
- Analyse different sections of the transport usage in NSW by evaluating the relationship between the tap-on and tap-off rates of Opal cards in 4 suburbs (Parramatta, Strathfield, Chatswood and Macquarie Park). 
- Compare the total uses of different transport modes in NSW, for example, monthly usage of trains and buses over a long period, and examine the impact of demographic factors (age group or personal income) on traveling trends.
